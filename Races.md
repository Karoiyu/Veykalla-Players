These are the most predominant races in the realm there are many more but in smaller amounts and even a few secluded from society
### Human's
As in most traditional worlds humans are the most common and have the biggest population in the realm. But when they are so many there will always be mass variation, they easily adapt to new terrains, climate's and circumstances. No human is alike all with different personalities, appearances, dreams and even nightmares.


### Orc's 
Unlike your traditional orc's they are more hospitable, communitive and cleaver. While they may be these things they still keep some more traditional strengths and if you piss them off they are still damn scary. Orc's don't adapt nearly as fast as humans and take my generations to move onto new lands, for this reason many Orc's will stay within the biomes there were born and raised in. It is pretty easy to tell where a orc is from due to each type of orc adapting there bodily builds and the change in skin colour that has changed over time as there bodies have adapted. There are 4 main colours of orc.

The green orcs that are generally found in forests, swamps and grasslands living and hunting with there clans. These orcs are a bit slimer than your typical human, with there bodies adapting to a life style of fast and agile hunting of wildlife and game.

The White orcs are generally found in Arctic, Tundra and Mountainous regions. They are the most big a burly type of orc's a bit bigger that your traditional orc. There bodies adapted to survive in the harsh cold, needing to be able to last for days with out food and water. 

The Red orcs generally found in Desert's, Savanna's and Brushland's. They are a bit bigger that normal humans as they need a good balance of strength a speed to navigate and Survive in the hotter climates. They are generally the most aggro clan as they seem themselves as part of the the larger animal kingdom sitting atop its throne rivalling the big cats and beasts of the land.

Lastly the Blue orcs, they are generally found in costal area's or at sea. They are the traditional orc build being made for heavy lifting and alot of drinking. Most blue orcs are either pirates, navel sailors or sea traders. They are generally the nicest of the orc's and always have a good story to tell, along side a few too many drinks.


### Dragonborn
Unlike the D&D dragonborns they are alot more humanlike. To describe them best they would be beastly draconic human's. They still keep there chromatic and metallic heritage, meaning alot of different types for dragonborns.

They mostly live in tribe's and are spread across the realm, All living in different biomes. The few tribe who live near each other will other be at each others fault and are very aggro. This aggressiveness comes from there already tribal like nature plus many times having to defend themselves from encroaching settlers who want to take there land. 

Ill write up where each colour resides at some point just not yet.


### Elves
They are very magically connected, each subrace, spire and region they live in are directly impacted by there magic. They are based on the core 4 elements of air, fire, earth and water plus light and dark. They are very high societal in how they live, they require and heir that can cast there type of magic and will marry off any children to other spires that are aligned with different types of magic. There subrace is genetically decided by the magic of there parents so it is possible to have a baby whos race is based on fire and the parents be both water.

### Silva
The long and short of it they are plant/tree people. They take on a very humanoid form, there skin in bark, blood is sap, bones are tightly woven stems and clothes, hair and other features are leaves and vines. They look pretty chaotic in looks with alot of plant going all over the place and change very quickly with the season. There look reflecting the current season. 

Due to being plants they don't need food to survive but will wither without water and sunlight for long periods of time. They generally are located in these big canopy cities found in big forests and jungles. There may be variations between there looks based on the type of forests and the plants they would have been formed from. 

They can eat and digest food but generally will eat very little, some northern silvas will eat plants to survive and can be seen as demoninc by other silvas as they consider themselves as part of the plant life ecosystem.
### Itaro (Musteloidea Folk)
These are the only small race we have. They are little humanoid furries..... wait hear me out each subrace is based on Musteloids. So everyones favourite little furballs of red panada's, raccons, otters, badgers, weasels and skunks. well may skunks aren't people favourites. 

They are generally very one sided they are either little angels or little devils, its impossible to tell them apart from looks and you can only tell once they start doing there shenanigans.  I really have no clue how the describe them rn expect they are small litte guys.

The Itaro generally are found in towns and cities, they like to be around people and naturally gravitate to where lots are.

### Aarakocra (Sathari)
hmm well they aren't really Aarakocra but are? Basically i don't like the physiology of how the Aarakocra are so these are more like the Sathari from star wars. There wings are actually there arms, they have bigger builds and more varied beaks and beak sizes. They cannot fly and but can use there arms to glide/float if they are already in the air. They have alot more vibrant and bright feathers. 

They generally live in packs but many have spread out across the land living a trader's, mercenaries or even settling down as smiths or merchants.
